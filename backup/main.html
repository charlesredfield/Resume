I'm Charles, and I am thrilled to apply for this career. As a licensed electrician apprentice specialized in solar with a passion for technology, appliance repair, and customer service. I believe my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this position. I have extensive experience working with various forms of technology, including desktop/laptop repair/building, phone/tablet repair, photovoltaic systems, and a multitude of different coding languages. My problem-solving skills are top-notch and I have a proven track record of troubleshooting and fixing any issue that arises, even little wins like fixing the electrical for my Girlfriend's garage. I have also worked with solar technology and I really enjoyed the experience contructing and troubleshooting those big behmoths. Unfortunately, my previous employer, POWERHOME Solar, went bankrupt. However, this experience has made me more determined than ever to succeed. Joining your team would be an exciting opportunity for me to continue to use my skills and knowledge to put smiles on faces! Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to demonstrate my abilities and passion during our interview and to show you that solar energy! <br> <br> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p>Name: Charles Redfield</p> </div> <br> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p>Birth Date: 01/09/2003, 20 years of age</p> </div> <br> <br> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p>Phone Number: +1 (734)-626-9377</p> </div> <br> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p>Email: charles.l.redfield@gmail.com</p> </div> <br> <br> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p>You can message me or call me on any of these platforms. I do respond to text more so than calls. My phone seems to get 100 spam calls a day. I'll answer every call to get this job it's just easier for me to answer by text or an email. </p> </div> <br> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p> Read the following containers below to learn more about me and what I've accomplished in 20 years.</p> </div> <div class="highlight slide-in from-left"> <div class="fade-in"> <h3>Prebuilt Computer and Device Repair Company</h3> </div> <div class="fade-in"> <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; font-weight: 400;">Throughout middle school and high school, I started a Prebuilt computer and technology repair business. I was able to build and repair over 100 devices, including computers, laptops, and smartphones. Whether it was a simple battery replacement or fixing a broken screen, I was able to figure out the issue and provide a solution that satisfied my customers. I developed strong problem solving skills and excellent customer service skills through this experience, which I believe will serve me well in my future endeavors.</p> </div> </div> <div class= "col fade-in"> <h2>PowerHome Solar</h2> </div> <div class= "col fade-in"> <p>I had the opportunity to work as a Solar Electrician and Repair Solar Technician at PowerHome Solar for two years. In this role, I was responsible for running repairs and installing solar systems for our customers. This often involved driving semi trucks full of equipment hours away to various job sites. A few of the challenges this job offered was working in extreme weather conditions, including being on a three story roof in the freezing cold trying to repair a system.The 2nd would be having to explain to high paying customers exactly what's wrong with their system betforms. I do respond to text more so than calls. My phone seems to get 100 spam calls a day. I'll answer every cacause someone severyly messed up on their install the week prior was never easy. When people pay a lot of money they tend get frustrated when things are going wrong which is understandable, we had a lot of careless guys on some of the other teams that made my job a bit more difficult, but at the end of the day we got their systems fixed and I put a smile on the customers face. That's all that matters. Another frustration was messing up roofs, if we were to peel back a single shingle and it ripped off then you would also have to be the one to go back up on the roof to replace it. Driving the semis for hours in snow and ice was a bit difficult as well but no where near as strenious as the other tasks. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed the opportunity to work with a cutting-edge technology and help customers conserve energy and reduce their carbon footprint. Unfortunately, PowerHome Solar went bankrupt and had to shut down, which has led me to seek a new career opportunity.</p> </div> <div class="highlight slide-in from-right"> <div class="fade-in"> <h3>Skills</h3> </div> <ul> <div class="fade-in"> <li style="padding: 5px; font-weight: 400;">Computer building and repair</li> </div> <div class="fade-in"> <li style="padding: 5px; font-weight: 400;">Solar panel installation and repair</li> </div> <div class="fade-in"> <li style="padding: 5px; font-weight: 400;">Strong problem solving skills</li> </div> <div class="fade-in"> <li style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding: 5px 5px 20px 5px; font-weight: 400;">Excellent customer service</li> </div> </ul> </div> <div class="slide-in from-left"> <center> <h2 style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color:1px solid black; font-family: CustomFont2; font-weight: bolder; color: #f58025; padding-bottom: 15px; padding: 10px; text-decoration-color: black; text-shadow: 1.5px 0px black; ">I will do very well here, but don't just go off of my word... <br>FIND OUT!</h2> </center> </div> </main> </body> </html>
